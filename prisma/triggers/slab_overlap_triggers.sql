-- KUN HRMS — Slab/Rate Overlap Prevention Triggers (Q5 — Option D approved)
--
-- Prevents overlapping (effectiveFrom, effectiveTo) date ranges for the same
-- `code` within each slab/rate table. Rolls back the INSERT/UPDATE if an
-- overlap is detected.
--
-- These triggers run AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE on:
--   1. TDSSlab
--   2. ProfessionalTaxSlab
--   3. EsiRate
--   4. PfRate
--
-- Overlap logic: two ranges [A.effectiveFrom, A.effectiveTo] and
-- [B.effectiveFrom, B.effectiveTo] overlap when:
--   A.effectiveFrom < COALESCE(B.effectiveTo, '9999-12-31')
--   AND B.effectiveFrom < COALESCE(A.effectiveTo, '9999-12-31')
-- NULL effectiveTo = open-ended (currently active).
--
-- This file is executed as a raw SQL step after `prisma migrate dev`.
